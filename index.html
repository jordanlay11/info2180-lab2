                <p>HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the backbone of every webpage. It provides the structure by
                    defining elements like headings, paragraphs, images, links, and more. Think of it as the blueprint
                    of a building — without it, there would be no foundation for web content. Every browser understands
                    HTML, which makes it the universal language of the web. Learning HTML is often the first step for
                    beginners in web development because it’s straightforward and shows how websites are built piece by
                    piece.<br><br>
                    What makes HTML powerful is its ability to work with other technologies. By itself, it organizes
                    content, but when combined with CSS and JavaScript, it turns into something much more dynamic and
                    visually appealing. For example, HTML can define a button, but CSS determines how it looks, and
                    JavaScript makes it interactive. This separation of structure, style, and behavior is what allows
                    developers to build everything from simple blogs to complex web applications.</p>

                <p>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is what brings beauty and personality to a website. While HTML handles
                    structure, CSS handles design — it controls colors, fonts, spacing, and layout. With CSS, a plain
                    HTML page can be transformed into something clean, modern, and user-friendly. The "cascading" part
                    means styles can be applied at different levels: directly on elements, within specific sections, or
                    across an entire site with a single stylesheet. This flexibility makes CSS incredibly efficient for
                    maintaining consistent design.<br><br>
                    Beyond simple styling, CSS has grown into a powerful tool for creating responsive designs. With
                    features like Flexbox and Grid, developers can make websites that adapt seamlessly to different
                    screen sizes, from mobile phones to desktops. CSS also allows for transitions, animations, and
                    effects that improve user experience without needing heavy scripts. In short, CSS is where
                    creativity meets functionality, turning raw structure into a polished and engaging interface.
